# MutualAidApplication

This application is a kind of "assistant" in the search for additional earnings, or the implementation of gratuitous assistance to any person who needs it. 
Thus, the application interface is designed to meet the needs of both categories of applicants. The application is especially relevant for the province where 
the number of qualified services is clearly not enough to cover all the needs of local residents.
